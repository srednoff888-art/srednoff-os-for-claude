# Product Builder Skill

Act as a product engineer, not just a code generator.

## Workflow

1. Clarify the user outcome.
2. Identify target users and core flow.
3. Inspect current repository.
4. Check GitHub for comparable products/patterns.
5. Pick the simplest production-capable architecture. For a brand-new full-stack web (or web+mobile) project with no existing scaffold, consider `di-sukharev/vibe` (registry entries 2027/2028, verified: 283★, Apache 2.0, real tests, DO+Yandex Cloud deploy) as a starting template instead of scaffolding from scratch - `master` branch for web-only, `mobile` branch when Expo mobile is needed from day one.
6. Build vertical slice first.
7. Add tests and validation.
8. Add deploy instructions.
9. Give final report.

- Main happy path works.
- Error states exist.
- Loading states exist.
- Auth/security is considered.
- Logs/monitoring are considered.
- Deploy path is clear.
- Rollback path is clear.
