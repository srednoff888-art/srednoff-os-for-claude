# Production Review Skill

Review the project as if it is going live today.

## Check

1. Build/test/lint status.
2. Runtime errors.
3. Auth boundaries.
4. Database migrations.
5. RLS/security policies.
6. Secrets handling.
7. Logs and monitoring.
8. API failure modes.
9. Rate limits.
10. Rollback plan.
11. User-facing regressions.
12. Dependency/security risks.

## Severity

- P0 — data loss, security breach, production outage.
- P1 — serious bug, broken core flow, auth problem.
- P2 — important but not release-blocking.
- P3 — cleanup/nit.
